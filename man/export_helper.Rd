\title{Export Helper Function}
\usage{
export_helper(enabled_selections, file_list, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{enabled_selections}{A named list where each element represents a file to export.
Each element contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{type}: Character string indicating the object type ("geospatial", "dataset", "raster", "plot")
\item \code{format}: Character string specifying the export format (e.g., "gpkg", "csv", "png")
}}

\item{file_list}{A named list of R objects to be exported. Names should match those in \code{enabled_selections}.}

\item{file}{Character string. The output file path where the export should be written.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the file path where the export was written.
}
\description{
Internal helper function that processes export selections and coordinates the actual
file writing operations. Handles both single file exports and multi-file ZIP archives.
}
\details{
This function orchestrates the export process by:
\itemize{
\item For single file exports: directly calls \code{\link{write_file_helper}} with the appropriate object and format
\item For multi-file exports: creates a temporary directory, exports each file individually, then packages everything into a ZIP archive
}

The function uses temporary directories for multi-file exports to avoid conflicts and
ensure clean packaging. The temporary directory is automatically managed and cleaned up.

\code{\link{write_file_helper}} for the actual file writing logic
\code{\link{exportServer}} for the main export server function
