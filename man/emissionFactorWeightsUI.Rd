\title{Emission Factor Weights Editor Modal UI}
\usage{
emissionFactorWeightsUI(id)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character string. The namespace identifier for this module instance.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[shiny:modalDialog]{shiny::modalDialog()}} object containing the weight editing interface
with organized sliders, real-time validation, and action buttons.
}
\description{
This UI function generates a modal dialog with two main sections:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Surveillance Measures} (must sum to 2.0): Disease notification, targeted
surveillance, general surveillance, and screening programs
\item \strong{Control Measures} (must sum to 3.0): Border precautions, emergency slaughter,
selective culling, movement zoning, and vaccination programs
}

The interface shows real-time subtotals and validates that weights sum to the
correct totals (surveillance: 2.0, control: 3.0, overall: 5.0).
}
\details{
Creates a modal dialog interface for editing emission factor weights.
The UI displays organized sliders for surveillance and control measure weights
with real-time subtotal calculations to ensure proper weighting constraints.
}
\section{Weight Constraints}{

The weights must satisfy these constraints from the emission risk algorithm:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Surveillance measures total}: 2.0 points
\item \strong{Control measures total}: 3.0 points
\item \strong{Overall total}: 5.0 points
\item \strong{Individual range}: 0.0 to 3.0 for each factor
}
}
