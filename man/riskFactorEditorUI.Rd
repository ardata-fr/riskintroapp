\title{Risk Factor Editor Modal UI}
\usage{
riskFactorEditorUI(id, country_id)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{Character string. The namespace identifier for this module instance.}

\item{country_id}{Character string. The ISO3 country code (e.g., "USA", "FRA") for the
country being edited.}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[shiny:modalDialog]{shiny::modalDialog()}} object containing the risk factor editing interface
with organized tables, real-time scoring, and action buttons.
}
\description{
This UI function generates a modal dialog with four main sections:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Surveillance Measures} (2/12 points): Disease notification, targeted surveillance,
general surveillance, and screening programs
\item \strong{Control Measures} (3/12 points): Border precautions, emergency slaughter,
selective culling, movement zoning, and vaccination programs
\item \strong{Commerce} (0-4/12 points): Legal and illegal animal trade status
\item \strong{Epidemiological Status} (0-3/12 points): Time since last outbreak
}

The interface shows real-time risk score calculations and validates that the total
score matches the emission risk algorithm from \code{\link[riskintroanalysis:calc_emission_risk]{riskintroanalysis::calc_emission_risk()}}.
}
\details{
Creates a modal dialog interface for editing emission risk factors for a specific country.
The UI displays organized tables for surveillance, control, commerce, and epidemiological factors
with real-time risk score calculations.
}
\section{Risk Factor Categories}{

The risk factors are organized by category with specific point contributions:

\strong{Surveillance Measures (2/12 total)}:
\itemize{
\item Disease notification system
\item Targeted surveillance
\item General surveillance
\item Screening programs
}

\strong{Control Measures (3/12 total)}:
\itemize{
\item Border precautions
\item Emergency slaughter
\item Selective culling & disposal
\item Movement zoning
\item Official vaccination programs
}

\strong{Commerce (0-4/12 total)}:
\itemize{
\item No trade: 0 points
\item Legal trade only: 1 point
\item Illegal trade only: 3 points
\item Both legal and illegal: 4 points
}

\strong{Epidemiological Status (0-3/12 total)}:
\itemize{
\item No outbreaks (>5 years): 0 points
\item Time-based decay for recent outbreaks
\item Current outbreak: 3 points
}
}
